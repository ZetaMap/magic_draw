# Magic Draw
A small program based on Cosines, Sines and Tangents, which shows you who draws equations in different forms, each one prettier than the next. <br>
To add your own representation, add it to the '\_list' list in the form: ("x calcul", "y calcul"). <br>
There are two variables to use: p and i.
